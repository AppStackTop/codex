# Introduction
**Codex** is a simple file-based Markdown documentation platform built on top of Laravel. It's completely customizable and dead simple to use to create beautiful documentation.

## Completely Open Source
I built Codex to be open and available to *everyone*. Documentation is incredibly important that can make or break even the best development projects. This is why the code powering Codex is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/caffeinated/codex) under the [MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).

In short, I want to see beautiful documentation being written everywhere! No excuses!

## Features
- Laravel 4.2
- Github-flavored Markdown
- Host an unlimited number of *manuals* with accompanying *versions*
- Code highlighting
- Easy TOC / navigation system
- SEO friendly URLs
- Simple search
- Supports Google Analytics
- Supplied theme built on Bootstrap

> **Note** that while Codex is pretty much feature complete and good to use in production, I am still working on the documentation here. So please bear with me!
